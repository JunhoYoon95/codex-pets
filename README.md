# Codex Pets

Unofficial, fan-made animated companions for the Codex app and Codex CLI.

Pick a pet, download it, and let it keep you company while Codex works. No coding is required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need a version of the Codex/ChatGPT desktop app that includes **Settings > Pets**. Pet availability can depend on your app version, account, or workspace.
> One-click shared pet installation is also a separately enabled feature. On unsupported accounts, the link only opens Codex and downloads nothing. Use the ZIP installation option instead.

## Choose your pet

Open a pet's download page and choose **Download pet files (.zip)**. The optional **Try one-click install** button works only when shared pet installation is enabled for your Codex app and account.

## Quick start

1. Click **Download / install** next to the pet you want.
2. Press **Download pet files (.zip)**.
3. Follow the [manual installation steps](#manual-installation) to copy the selected pet folder into the Codex pets directory.
4. Restart Codex, then open your profile menu and select **Pets**. You can also open **Settings > Pets**.
5. Select your new pet.
6. Type `/pet` in a chat, or open the command menu and select **Wake Pet**.

Run `/pet` again or select **Tuck Away Pet** when you want to hide it.

> [!TIP]
> **Try one-click install** is optional and has limited availability. If it only opens Codex, nothing was downloaded or installed; use the ZIP steps below.

## 한국어 빠른 설치

1. 위 목록에서 원하는 펫의 **Download / install**을 눌러 다운로드 페이지를 엽니다.
2. **Download pet files (.zip)**을 눌러 ZIP 파일을 받습니다.
3. 아래의 [수동 설치](#manual-installation) 안내에 따라 원하는 펫 폴더를 Codex의 `pets` 폴더로 복사합니다.
4. Codex를 재시작한 다음 프로필 메뉴의 **Pets** 또는 **Settings > Pets**로 이동합니다.
5. 설치한 펫을 선택합니다.
6. 채팅에 `/pet`을 입력하거나 명령 메뉴에서 **Wake Pet**을 선택합니다.

**Try one-click install**을 눌렀을 때 Codex만 열리고 설치 창이 나타나지 않으면 아무 파일도 다운로드되거나 설치되지 않은 것입니다. 아래의 [수동 설치](#manual-installation)를 이용하세요. 터미널이나 개발 지식 없이도 ZIP 파일을 내려받아 설치할 수 있습니다.

## Manual installation

Use this method if the **Install in Codex** link does not work.

### Option A: Download the ZIP — no terminal required

1. At the top of this GitHub page, click the green **Code** button, then **Download ZIP**.
2. Unzip the downloaded `codex-pets-main.zip` file.
3. Open the extracted `codex-pets-main/pets` folder.
4. Copy the folder for the pet you want. For example, copy `white-no7-celebration`.
5. Paste that folder into the Codex pets directory:
   - **macOS:** In Finder, press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>, enter `~/.codex/pets`, and press Return.
   - **Windows:** In File Explorer's address bar, enter `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\pets` and press Enter.
   - If the `pets` folder does not exist, create it inside `.codex`.
6. Restart the Codex app, or open a new Codex window.
7. Open **Settings > Pets**, select the installed pet, and run `/pet` to wake it.

The final folder structure should look like this:

```text
.codex/
└── pets/
    └── white-no7-celebration/
        ├── pet.json
        └── spritesheet.webp
```

Avoid an extra nested folder such as `pets/codex-pets-main/pets/white-no7-celebration`; Codex will not find the pet there.

### Option B: Terminal

Install one pet from a cloned copy of this repository:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/pets
cp -R pets/white-no7-celebration ~/.codex/pets/
```

Replace `white-no7-celebration` with any pet ID from the table above.

To install every pet at once:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/pets
cp -R pets/* ~/.codex/pets/
```

Then restart Codex or open a new Codex window.

## Using a pet in Codex CLI

Compatible custom pets installed on your computer also appear in an interactive Codex CLI session:

- Enter `/pets` or `/pet` to open the pet picker.
- Enter `/pets ` followed by a name to choose a pet directly.
- Enter `/pets off` to turn terminal pets off.

Terminal pets require iTerm2 3.6 or later, or a terminal with Kitty graphics or Sixel support. They do not work inside tmux or Zellij. The Codex IDE extension does not currently include a pet picker or floating pet overlay.

## Updating or removing a pet

To update a manually installed pet, replace its folder in `~/.codex/pets` with the newer folder from this repository, then restart Codex.

To remove one, delete only that pet's folder from `~/.codex/pets`, then restart Codex. You can also manage pets from **Settings > Pets** when the app provides that option.

## Troubleshooting

### The install link does nothing

- Make sure the Codex desktop app is installed and up to date.
- Try opening this README in a regular browser instead of a GitHub mobile or desktop client.
- Check whether your browser blocked the request to open Codex.
- Use [Manual installation](#manual-installation) if app links are blocked.

### The pet does not appear in Settings

- Confirm that the folder is directly inside `~/.codex/pets` on macOS/Linux or `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\pets` on Windows.
- Confirm that `pet.json` and `spritesheet.webp` are directly inside the pet folder.
- Restart Codex or open a new Codex window after copying the files.
- The Pets feature may not yet be enabled for your app version, account, or workspace.

### The pet appears but does not move

Pets respect your operating system's **Reduce Motion** accessibility setting. When reduced motion is enabled, Codex shows a still frame instead of the animation.

### The pet does not appear in the IDE extension

This is expected. Use the Codex desktop app or a supported Codex CLI terminal. See the [official Pets guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pets) for current product support.

## What's in each pet folder?

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pet.json` | Name, description, sprite version, and spritesheet path used by Codex. |
| `spritesheet.webp` | The Codex v2 animated spritesheet. This is the file installed by the one-click link. |
| `preview.gif` | A lightweight animated preview for GitHub. |
| `contact-sheet.png` | A full animation contact sheet for inspection. |
| `look-directions.png` | A QA sheet for v2 look directions. |
| `validation.json` | The latest atlas validation result. |
